The application first calls the CoinGecko API to get the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. It presents the list to the user, and the user selects which coin they want to analyze.

The application then prompts the user for the period of time they want to analyze, either 24 hours, 7 days, or 1 year.

If the user selects 24 hours, the application generates a report with the predicted price of the selected cryptocurrency for each hour over the next 24 hours, based on a machine learning algorithm.

If the user selects 7 days, the application generates a report with the predicted price of the selected cryptocurrency for each day over the next 7 days, based on a machine learning algorithm.

If the user selects 1 year, the application generates a report with the predicted price of the selected cryptocurrency for each month over the next year, based on a machine learning algorithm.

If the user selects a specific cryptocurrency (e.g. Bitcoin), the application sends a request to the CoinGecko API to get the current price and historical price data for that cryptocurrency. The historical price data is used as the input for the machine learning algorithm to predict future prices.

Once the report is generated, it is stored in an Excel spreadsheet with two columns: the first column contains the current and future prices for the selected cryptocurrency, and the second column contains the corresponding dates.

If the user wants to analyze another cryptocurrency or time period, they can repeat the process.
